						<li>This nav bar is in an aside element, nested in the header element. Aside elements are used to house information for the webpage that are tangetially related to the current pages information. Something like ads or sidebars are typical.</li>

				<p>This page will test the section type elements of HTML. Tested here are:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>&lt;article&gt;</li>
					<li>&lt;section&gt;</li>
					<li>&lt;nav&gt;</li>
					<li>&lt;aside&gt;</li>
					<li>&lt;header&gt;</li>
					<li>&lt;footer&gt;</li>
					<li>&lt;address&gt;</li>
				</ul>
				<p>Text up to here has been included in a &lt;header&gt; element, including the &lt;nav&gt;.</p>
		</header>
		
		<hr>
		<h2>Below is an &lt;article&gt; element.</h2>
			<article>
				<h4>Articles should have a heading</h4>
				<p>Articles are meant to be independent sections of pages that are redistributable. Typically, this means that they are blog posts or comments or other things that can be moved page to page. Here, it is just this simple text block, but they can also follow schemas to help with formatting.</p>
			</article>
		
		<hr>
		<h2>Below this is a &lt;section&gt; element</h2>
			<section>
				<h4>Sections should also have a heading</h4>
				<p>Sections are meant to just split areas of pages up, they don't do much otherwise. Unless you are building an outline or something, you dont need to use sections. It's reccomended to use &lt;div&gt; instead.</p>
			</section>

		<hr>
		<h2>Below this is a &lt;footer&gt; element</h2>
		<footer>
			<p>This is a sitewide footer. Each article or section element could also have a footer. I can dump links like <a href="index.html">Index</a> here. This is also where I can copyright things, like &copy; 2015 Team BSOD.
			<br>Also included in this footer is the &lt;address&gt; element, which should be used to link to the appropriate page for contact information. For this page, that will be the "about us" page.</p>

		<hr>
		<h2>Below this is a &lt;address&gt; element</h2>	
			<address><a href="team.html">About us</a></address>	
		</footer>	

	<br><br>This page validates.
