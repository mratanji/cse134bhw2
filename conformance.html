	<h1>Conformance</h1>
	<p>This page describes conformance issues we discovered ovwer browsers. The browsers we used include Chrome, IE, and FireFox.<br>
	One noticeable difference is that when directly pasting html into the web validator, it doesnt care if character sets is nmot defined in the head element, but within browsers when deployed to a website it does care (link checking). It also appears that athere are slight differences in the sizing of the h12-h6 headers, as well as the spacing with hr elements (annd their thickness). Accross the board, Chrome is very similar to IE when it comes to the size and spacing of elements, and both chrome/IE seem to make elements bigger than firefox. <br>
	One of the more noticeable difference accross the browsers is how they handle Ruby elements. It would appear that all three browsers are different, but also that there are some tags that are not supported in FF. Chrome seems to handle the rb and rp elements the best, folowed by IE, and lastly FF.<br>
	IE also does not seem to be able to handle the wbr element, while Chrome and FF can handle it just fine.<br>
	Chrome seems to have problems handling our object and param elements, but FF and IE can handle them fine. However, IE cannot handle the audio and source elements we pass to it, while Chrome and FF both are OK with it.<br>
	Chrome, IE, and FF all handle the meter and progress elements differently. Or, at least, they all look different.<br>
	Also handled differently is the keygen element, which doesn't appear to be supported in IE yet. <br>

	That's it for our conformance testing! Hope it was sufficient enough.
