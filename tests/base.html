	This page is to test the base element. The base element allows the author of the webpage to set what the root url of the website is, allowing you to use relative link paths in the webpage when using href or target attributes. We have set the base to be this page, clicking <a href="index.html">here</a> takes you to the index, since we set the href to be to "index.html".
