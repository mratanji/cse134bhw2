		<h1>The &lt;html&gt;, &lt;head&gt;, &lt;body&gt;, and &lt;title&gt; elements</h1>
		<p>This is testing a very basic html page. Also included here is a head element containing a correct title element followed by a body element, as required by HTML specification. This page is testing the correct implementation of an html, head, body, and title elements. <a href="head_incorrect_v1.html">Here</a> is a link to a html page which consists of only a head element, which should fail. <a href="html_no_head_body_incorrect.html">This</a> is a link to a page that has only the html element. That page should also fail validation. <a href="title_incorrect.html">This</a> is a page with two title elements, which also should fail validation.</p>
		<hr>
		<br><br>This page will successfully validate.
